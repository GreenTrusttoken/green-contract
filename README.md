GREENTRUST the foremost Eco-friendly Cryptocurrency 
GreenTrust is conceived as a sustainable DeFi application providing advanced features via a highly generalized programming language based on Binance Smart Chain. What generates interest about GreenTrust, however, is that it moves far beyond just cryptocurrency.

How the project is born? Released April 19, 2021, on the Binance Smart Chain network, the GreenTrust project has been iteratively built and improved upon by the community since its inception. The Greentrust team and community as a whole, really trust in these goals. A group of Engineers, Graphic designers, web developers, data scientists and marketers, have contributed to help GreenTrust token to grow and became a solid project based on a combination with the cryptomarket and the green economy, this model of community-driven, has brought the project in success

What GreenTrust unique? The goal of GreenTrust token is to contrast the carbon emission of the blockchain technology, among several other concepts being developed in partnership with GreenTrust, have the potential to contribute to substantially increase the efficiency of the computational industry, and ultimately reduce its impact on the environment. On the other hand, our signature 'Tree Trust' initiative will have a direct impact by planting, directly or through affiliated NGOs, trees capable of stocking 340 kg of CO2 each. We estimate that 1 Pinus pinea can be planted to compensate for emissions caused by every 600 GNT transactions.

Greentrust strives to become the principal token involved in climate change, If you care about the planet and want to be part of a movement that truly wants to make a difference, this is your chance!!

The goal of GreenTrust token is to contrast the carbon emission of blockchain technology, through several initiatives worldwide, as well as partnership with no-profit association involved in the green initiative. The Greentrust team and community as a whole, really trust in these goals.

In regards to our current aspirations, we are a newly-born project looking for a trustable exchange listing to jointly develop our concept. Our initial goal is to increase the number of holders of our token in order to create a critical mass of supply that would enable smooth market circulation and hence provide credibility and sustainability to our long-term ambitions.
